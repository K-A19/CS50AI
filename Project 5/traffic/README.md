In the end I settled to for the most part just increasing my convulation layers. I noticed increasing pooling layers made the results less accurate significantly and increasing hidden layers took up so much more time in respect to the accuracy icrease they caused. Thus as this would be a model on a car recognising a sign, I valued time slightly more than accuracy. In the end i got an accuracy of about 98% in 2 seconds which would be great for a car.
